# AmieMProject2-crudApp

## User Story 
As a movie enthusiast It’s not always easy to come up with what movie to watch next. Nor is it always easy to watch the trailer, and see what streaming apps the movie is available on all in the SAME place. 
Well no fear, if I go onto Amie’s application I can scroll through the full list or choose based on a genre I’d like to watch. I can see everything I need to know in order to decide if I want to watch a movie. 
The movie icon in the top left of the page is clickable which I found easier to click sometimes to get me back to the home page. 
The movie covers are also clickable which I found useful as well, especially if I am accessing it on my mobile phone.
Oh AND if there’s a must see movie I’d like to share I can add a movie to the list and it will populate on the page. 
The layout is easy to digest, and easy to decipher between each movie. The hover effect is greatly appreciated so I am aware of what movie I am clicking on. 
The streaming icons are a great way to get right from the website to the streaming service I choose to watch the movie on. 
If a streaming service has changed I am able to update it as well, which I find very useful. 
Everything I need as a movie enthusiast is available to me on this app! Wow! I will be using this for the rest of my movie journey! 

## Planning Process
I knew I wanted all the movies to have the movie cover on the page - since that’s a big part of movies - the cover!! I had to decide what would go inside my schema to populate the page. I decided on the title, genre, director, year, and 3 streaming options. I later decided to add the trailer because some people like to choose movies based on what actors/actresses are in the movie. I for sure wanted the director to be featured because this whole app idea was spurred off by my boyfriend  who is actually a movie enthusiast himself, and has his own list of movies to watch separated by directors which I found very useful! He always has to go off his list to search on google “where to watch”, so I thought it would be useful to create an app of his list and more movies I enjoy too, that looks aesthetically pleasing with all the information you need in one place. I was searching on bootstrap for some layout features and I clicked on cards and found the perfect layout I could envision all of the movies inside of. It really worked out great for me in the end. Everything is easy to digest - I didn’t want to have too many distracting colors since all movie colors would be different so leaving a white background seemed to be the right choice. I also wanted the cards to stand out on the page rather than sink into it. So I added some effects to make that happen. I knew I wanted a find by genre feature because I know that’s how a lot of people choose what to watch based on genre. 

## Feature to add 
Going forward once we learn user authentication I want to add that as a feature so people can start with these movies I have but then delete and add as they please so its more personal to the user rather than me feeding them all the movies. And also too so my boyfriend can fully use this everyday and whoever else is a movie enthusiast. I also would like to add a search feature so people can say oh let me find this movie quickly. I think those would be 2 very useful addition to my app.
